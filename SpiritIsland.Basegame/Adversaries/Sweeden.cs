/*

1	(2)	9 (3/3/3)	Heavy Mining: If the Invaders do at least 6 Damage to the land during Ravage, add an extra Blighticon.png. The additional Blighticon.png does not destroy Presence or cause cascades.
2	(3)	10 (3/4/3)	Population Pressure at Home: During Setup, on each board add 1 Cityicon.png to land #4. On boards where land #4 starts with Blighticon.png, put that Blighticon.png in land #5 instead.
3	(5)	10 (3/4/3)	Fine Steel for Tools and Guns: Townicon.png deal 3 Damage. Cityicon.png deal 5 Damage.
4	(6)	11 (3/4/4)	Royal Backing: During Setup, after adding all other Invaders, discard the top card of the Invader Deck. On each board, add 1 Townicon.png to the land of that terrain with the fewest Invaders.
5	(7)	12 (4/4/4)	Mining Rush: When Ravaging adds at least 1 Blighticon.png to a land, also add 1 Townicon.png to an adjacent land without Townicon.png/Cityicon.png. Cascading Blighticon.png does not cause this effect.
6	(8)	13 (4/4/5)	Prospecting Outpost: During setup, on each board add 1 Townicon.png and 1 Blighticon.png to land #8. The Blighticon.png comes from the box, not the Blight Card.
