/*

1	(2)	9 (3/3/3)	Heavy Mining: 
	If the Invaders do at least 6 Damage to the land during Ravage, add an extra Blight. 
	The additional Blight does not destroy Presence or cause cascades.

2	(3)	10 (3/4/3)	Population Pressure at Home: 
	During Setup, on each board add 1 City to land #4.
	On boards where land #4 starts with Blight, put that Blight in land #5 instead.

3	(5)	10 (3/4/3)	Fine Steel for Tools and Guns:
	Town deal 3 Damage
	City deal 5 Damage

4	(6)	11 (3/4/4)	Royal Backing: 
	During Setup, after adding all other Invaders, discard the top card of the Invader Deck.
	On each board, add 1 Town to the land of that terrain with the fewest Invaders.

5	(7)	12 (4/4/4)	Mining Rush: 
	When Ravaging adds at least 1 Blight to a land, also add 1 Town to an adjacent land without Town/City.
	Cascading Blight does not cause this effect.

6	(8)	13 (4/4/5)	Prospecting Outpost: 
	During setup, on each board add 1 Town and 1 Blight to land #8.
	The Blight comes from the box, not the Blight Card.
