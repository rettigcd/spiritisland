// Option 1: Cards only work once they've been 'Bound'
// Option 2: Cards don't bind to user, wrapper does binding.
// Option 3: create 2 classes for each card
// Option 4: Self-shunt!

// !!!!!!    Cards are static
//      But when they are being played, they have instance variables.
// Therefore, we need separate classes for instance OR they need reset each play
