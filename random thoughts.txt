Finder Issues
	- (hard) Layout of Presence Tracks
	- (med-hard) Make 2 of your lands adjacent. If presence moves out, no longer adjacent.

Presence Track Options
	- Ignore Visual representation
	- custom Drawer
	- Presence outputs a Layout Graph with directions and locations.

Make Terrain Adjacent
	Option - Add it to the beginning of all of Finder's Actions.

	Option - Add to every flow, Auto-Set Value in the UI to make it not painful
	Option - Secondary Thread where spirits can request it
	Option - Secondary Thread where Finder just does it
