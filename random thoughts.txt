ICalcSource / Spirit.SourceCalc

		MistsShiftAndFlow.PresenceMeetsTargettingRequirements

Spirit.TargetsSpace
	called from:
		TargetSpaceAttribute - Yes
		CarapadedLands - Yes
	changed by:

Oversees Trade Seems safer
Dahan on their Guard
	- in each land.. defend

Dahan Enheartened
Retreat
Seek Safety
	- doesn't allow pushing dahan out, nor gathering dahan in)

Cards With Range on them

	Blazing Renewal (does the land placement restrictions still apply?)
	Unrelenting Growth( does the land placement restrictions still apply? )
	Gift of Proliferation
	Bargans of Power and Protection
	Unleash a Torrent of The Self's Own Essence
	Utter A Curse of Dread And Bone
	Perils of the Deepest Island

Resolve:
	RangeCalc usage
	Spirit.GetTargetOptions
	Spirit.TargetsSpace(...)
	Blazing Renewal
	BoundPresence.Range...

	BlazingRenewal calls Spirit.GetTargetOptions but should call BoundPresence or TargetSpaceCtx instead instead.
