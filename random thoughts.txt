Cards With Range on them

	Blazing Renewal (does the land placement restrictions still apply?)
	Unrelenting Growth( does the land placement restrictions still apply? )
	Gift of Proliferation
	Bargans of Power and Protection
	Unleash a Torrent of The Self's Own Essence
	Utter A Curse of Dread And Bone
	Perils of the Deepest Island

Resolve:
	RangeCalc usage
	Spirit.GetTargetOptions
	Spirit.TargetsSpace(...)
	Blazing Renewal
	BoundPresence.Range...

	BlazingRenewal calls Spirit.GetTargetOptions but should call BoundPresence or TargetSpaceCtx instead instead.
