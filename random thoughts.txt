Oversees Trade Seems safer
Dahan on their Guard

Option 1 - Make Fear Card implement .Activate() (not .Resolve) that can be overridden to add invader card.
Option 2 - Make generic Card that implements .OnRevealed()



public void Activate( GameState gameState ) {
	var topCard = gameState.Fear.Deck.Pop();
	if( topCard != this )
		throw new InvalidOperationException("Fear card must be on top of deck to activate it.");
	gameState.Fear.ActivatedCards.Push( this );
}

Is DahanBinding generic enough to use for individual Invaders?

Can SpaceState have a read-only version and a ActionScope-ready version.
