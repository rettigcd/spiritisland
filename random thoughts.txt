Updating Distance counts when we change if a space is in play.

Option 1
	- never cache it.  Calculate it fresh everytime.

Option 2
	- Every space that is in the cache, 
		add watch to .IsInPlayChanged
		if not in play, remove that space and everything higher from the cache, unsucscribe to event
		if in play, ??? Do what ??????

Option 3
	- when .IsInPlay changes, invalidate all the caches.
	- could store the cache in the island as a dictionary and then just clear it.



.IsInPlay changes for:
	- Ocean / Powers / Blight
	- Absolute Stasis
	- 

OceanTerrainForPower
	IsInPlay(  ){
		Has Ocean On it
	}


Need to update:
	.IsInPlay
	.Adjacent (and Range)


.IsInPlay varies for:
	Ocean
	Absolute Statis.

Option 1
	- place .IsInPlay property on Space that is settable.
	- true for everything except ocean
	- Absolute statis sets to false
	- Ocean-Power-Blight returns the || of OceansOcean and .IsInPlay
	- need to invalidate cache each time it is set/unset
	- Rewind needs to reset .IsInPlay to original values.

Option 2
	- Bind the Tokens to the Space
	- store InPlay token in the space
	- rewind: no special considerations.

Option 3
	- create a StasisList
