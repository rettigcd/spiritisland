1	(3)	10 (3/3/4)	Hunters Bring Home Shell and Hide: During Setup, on each board, add 1 {{{width}}}px and 1 Explorer to the highest-numbered land without Town/City. During Play, Explorer do +1 Damage. When Ravage adds Blight to a land (including cascades), Destroy 1 {{{width}}}px in that land.
2	(4)	11 (4/3/4)	A Sense for Impending Disaster: The first time each Action would Destroy Explorer: If possible, 1 of those Explorer is instead Pushed; 1 Fear when you do so.
3	(6)	11 (4/4/3)	Competition Among Hunters: Ravage Cards also match lands with 3 or more Explorer. (If the land already matched the Ravage Card, it still Ravages just once.)
4	(7)	12 (4/4/4)	Accelerated Exploitation: When making the Invader Deck, put 1 Stage III Card after each Stage II Card. (New Deck Order: 111-2-3-2-3-2-3-2-33)
5	(9)	13 (4/5/4)	Entrench in the Face of Fear: Put an unused Stage II Invader Card under the top 3 Fear Cards, and an unused Stage III Card under the top 7 Fear Cards. When one is revealed, immediately place it in the Build space (face-up).
6	(11)	14 (5/5/4)	Pressure for Fast Profit: After the Ravage Step of turn 2+, on each board where it added no Blight: In the land with the most Explorer (min. 1), add 1 Explorer and 1 Town.
