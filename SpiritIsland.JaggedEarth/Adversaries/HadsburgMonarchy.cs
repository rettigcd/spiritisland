/*

1	(3)	10 (3/4/3)	Migratory Herders: After the normal Build Step: In each land matching a Build Card, Gather 1 Town from a land not matching a Build Card. (In board/land order.)
2	(5)	11 (4/5/2)	More Rural Than Urban: During Setup, on each board, add 1 Town to land #2 and 1 Town to the highest-numbered land without Setup symbols. During Play, when Invaders would Build 1 City in an Inland land, they instead Build 2 Town.
3	(6)	12 (4/5/3)	Fast Spread: When making the Invader Deck, Remove 1 additional Stage I Card. (New deck order: 11-2222-33333)
4	(8)	12 (4/5/3)	Herds Thrive in Verdant Lands: Town in lands without Blight are Durable: they have +2 Health, and "Destroy Town" effects instead deal 2 Damage (to those Town only) per Town they could Destroy. ("Destroy all Town" works normally.)
5	(9)	13 (4/6/3)	Wave of Immigration: Before the initial Explore, put the Habsburg Reminder Card under the top 5 Invader Cards. When Revealed, on each board, add 1 City to a Coastal land without City and 1 Town to the 3 Inland lands with the fewest Blight.
6	(10)	14 (5/6/3)	Far-Flung Herds: Ravages do +2 Damage (total) if any adjacent lands have Town. (This does not cause lands without Invaders to Ravage.)
