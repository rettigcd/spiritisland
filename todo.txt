Fear cards look fuzzy. Generate larger pics?
Blight cards can be drawn better.

User Setting:
	Preloaded Token or not
Game Options
	Cast-down is Ocean or Sunk

When gathering multiple token types with multiple landing locations, just use the general Space location as central destination.

Cheat Menu - 
	Reclaim all cards, 
	Add Card To Hand, 
	+10 energy, 
	+5 of each elementt, 
	Return Blight to Card
	Activate Fear Card

4 Multi Player
	== Option 1 == 
		when starting action, make copy of the tokens
		- each action get an incremental ID
		- operate on the copy
		- track spaces
		- when done, commit => if any (spaces,spirits?,cards?) have been modified since start, rollback.
    -- Option 2 --
		- when interacting with spaces, have space join the Action
		- spaces that are part of an action cannot be joined to another action.
		- visual indication of which spaces are joined so user can wait or not select them
		- ! need to watch for deadlocks

4 Action => Move Finders Hook to Action-start - event

ManyMinds - Set out-of-band toggle on beasts, at start of action, make smart choices based on phase, then use user choice sync for powers

======

3 Fear Cards - ARE TOO SLOW!  Paint them on a known BG color so we can keep corners.
3 UI - Cleanup Presence-Track image generation
3 UI - Tokens - Publish token events to the UI so that it can show token changing animation.
3 Review items that are PickSpace then Pick Token into a single pick-space-token step.

2 Consilidate GameState API - things that aren't data and have no theoretical state.
2 Review Presence events. Can they be removed by having Presence do action directly? Consolidate => Single PresenceOnBoardChanged event
2 UI - Clean up Token drawing and ownership - CachedImageDrawer - make it draw the images
2 Create a target-space preview, when hovering over cards

TokenCountDictionary.counts -> make private.
Make Spirit.ResolveActions private/protected.

Idea - UI - When cusororing over HotSpot, have selected item glow / highlight
Idea - All of the Stop Tokens are actually just Pre-Build, Pre-Explore, Pre-Ravage events/configures
