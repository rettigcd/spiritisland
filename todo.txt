-- When Targetting spirits --
Bind Spirit to GameState
	=> when( picking a land, like normal card space targetting)
	=> create a secondary target-land context for the second spirit.


Game Play needs:
	- Undo / go back to beginning of turn
	- Visuals so we know when we are 
		(a) buying cards (b) selcting cards to play
		(a) selecting a push vs a gather space. (Lead the Furious assult)
	- logging game and results
	- catching exceptions in engine
	- catch GameOver exception (and display to user)

-- Bug --
Fear of the Unseen - Level 1 (program hung)
Lure of the Unknown - didn't allow be to target land with no invaders and withing 2 of presence

== Jonah ideas ===
make SS dispay differently

== Steam updates - What's New (provide insight as to what they have trouble with) ==
https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1236720

== Test Special Cases ==
Conceiling Shadows - no damage to dahan
A Year of Perfect Stillness - skips invader actions
Talons of Lightning - extended / conditional range 


Power Card Troubles
	Invinite Vitality - (+4 dahan health) - don't add blight, solution: swap out Blight action,
	Increase Range // custom attribute on card that overrides normal
	Sap the Strength of Multitudes - range changes
	EntwinedPower  (Does a bunch of stuff with placing presence and sharing power cards) -- instead of passing SS and Presence, pass in enum tellit it which to use (then it can override that behavior)
	Vengence of the Dead - need a hook for when dahan/city/towns destroyed, 

Fix
	Based on the size of the first card, calculate width required, if insufficient, add scroll bar.
	At the end of each ActionTree (maybe after each invader is destroyed?), test if we have a Terror Level victory.
	IF user selects damage distribution, who makes the choice, and which actions do we keep as automatic?

Improve
	Manually select who to apply damage to
	Display Icons (white w/#s)
	Display Card modifications slow/fast

Unit Test
	Thunderspeakers - move-with-the-dahan
	Harbinger of the Lightning
		- Elements, speed, cost
		- target - range 1
		- push 2 dahan
		- pushed into town or city triggers 1 fear
			- 2 pushed into same > 1
			- 2 pushed into different > 1
			- 1 pushed into town > 1
			- 1 pushed into city > 1
			- 1 pushed into explorer > 0
		- no dahan to push > doesn't crash
