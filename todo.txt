Tests - ChooseOption, ChooseFromOptions, (move prompt to last)

** Bind each Spirit Action to a CTX, so we can:
	- detect distinct actions
	- commit actions like transactions
	- Check win/lose state at the end of each action.

** Create a Token API  (MoveFrom,MoveTo,Destroy,Replace,Setup)

Refactor Testing to make it easier to test.

2) TargetSpaceCtx.DamageInvaders - limit badland damage to once / action
3) Detect end of game at end of each action, Don't Lock-up when it happens.
