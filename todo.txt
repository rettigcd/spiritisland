!!!!!!!!!!! don't lock up when we win / lose / exception 
	- split User-Gateway into 2 parts, one that blocks (for tests), and one that doesn't (for UI thread)

* Detect Win/Lose and don't lock up
	* Fear victory - End of deck
	* Fear victory - Destroyed enough of Cities / Town to meat terror level condition
	* Invader Deck loss
	* Blighted Island Loss
	* no presence Loss

-- Helpful --

Make Spirit & Board part of game # -> Enter Game # to replay
In log, show == Round ==,  -- Growth -- -- Fast -- -- Invader --  --- Slow -- (debug)

** Create a Token API  (MoveFrom,MoveTo,Destroy,Replace,Setup)

Refactor Testing to make it easier to test.

Refactor UI - to make cleaner and ready to port to Android
	- Put Build / Ravage / fear in strip along the top
	- Make Spirit shrink to fit in window
	- Separate cards into: Hand, Activated, Discarded
	UI - Sort Cards by: speed, element, cost, (HAND,PURCHASED,DISCARDED)

2) TargetSpaceCtx.DamageInvaders - limit badland damage to once / action
3) Detect end of game at end of each action, Don't Lock-up when it happens.
UI Visual indicator of Phase
UI - Display Trickster innate-drawn cards to user.
UI - Show fear cards while they are being resolved.
UI - Fear text needs some spaces in it.

UI - If all clickable options are highlighted the same, maybe draw them off of the HotSpots list instead of in each control.

Make Push a 1-step commmand
	- for custom destinations, add them to Push API
	- Embed guaranteed next decision in selecting source token
	- UI selects entire move before sequentially submitting: source token, destination
