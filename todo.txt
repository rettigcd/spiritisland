=============================
===== Basegame Road Map =====
BUG - Lightnings Air-power that makes things fast, ended with no-options ('-') after buying 2 cheap cards
BUG - Gift of Proliferation
IMP - Entwined share presence for targetting

BASE	Review Major / Minor, decide which need Unit Tests and Implement - Targets SPIRITS
BONUS	Generate Innate images from innate metadata
======  Done  ================
==============================

== Jonah ideas ===
make SS dispay differently

== Steam updates - What's New (provide insite as to what they have trouble with) ==
https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1236720

== Test Special Cases ==
Conceiling Shadows - no damage to dahan
A Year of Perfect Stillness - skips invader actions
Talons of Lightning - extended / conditional range 


Power Card Troubles
	Invinite Vitality - (+4 dahan health) - don't add blight, solution: swap out Blight action,
	Increase Range // custom attribute on card that overrides normal
	Sap the Strength of Multitudes - range changes
	EntwinedPower  (Does a bunch of stuff with placing presence and sharing power cards) -- instead of passing SS and Presence, pass in enum tellit it which to use (then it can override that behavior)
	Vengence of the Dead - need a hook for when dahan/city/towns destroyed, 

Fix
	Based on the size of the first card, calculate width required, if insufficient, add scroll bar.
	At the end of each ActionTree (maybe after each invader is destroyed?), test if we have a Terror Level victory.
	IF user selects damage distribution, who makes the choice, and which actions do we keep as automatic?

Improve
	Manually select who to apply damage to
	Display Icons (white w/#s)
	Display Card modifications slow/fast

Unit Test
	Thunderspeakers - move-with-the-dahan
	Harbinger of the Lightning
		- Elements, speed, cost
		- target - range 1
		- push 2 dahan
		- pushed into town or city triggers 1 fear
			- 2 pushed into same > 1
			- 2 pushed into different > 1
			- 1 pushed into town > 1
			- 1 pushed into city > 1
			- 1 pushed into explorer > 0
		- no dahan to push > doesn't crash

	Destroying Town or Town1 creates 1 fear
	Destroying City, City1, City 2, creates 2 fear
