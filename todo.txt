----- Spirit Island ----

* Adversaries
	show flag
	Log setup adjustments

* Command-Beast
	show graphic (so it doesn't get lost in text)

* Display back of explorer card.



Some Commands need a title like the Power Card Name, other's need detailed description of what they do.

Idea: Flatten GrowthOption => GrowthAction so user just picks growth actions.
Fear Card - convert to Commands

Create TargetSpaceCtx filter type.

Adjusting Hue for tokens:  RGB > YIQ > YIQ > RGB
===============================

== Architecture ==
Run on Android
Multiplayer Network Play

== Features ==
Event Alternative
Downpour / Finder of Paths Unseen
Adversary

== UI improvement ==
Flatten Growth
Flatten Move
Flatten - select land / Select Invader
Interactive Card-Play selector w/ commit
Event driven UI updates
Flatten out-of-phase action selection.

== Missing ==
Destroy Board
Add new board.
Unlock the Gates - triggers all element thresholds
Revamp Skips - only skip actions that happen, select which skip to use, don't need to select skip until it happens.
Settle into Hunting Grounds - presence can't move.
Absolute Statis - hides towns/cities from win/loss check
Display Back side of Invader card

== Verify ==
Starlights Track has +1 energies
Vengeance - WreakVengeance for the Lands Corruption
VolcanoLoomingHigh doesn't allow presence ouside of mountain

== Idea ==
Defer using reflection for Power Cards as long as possible.
Defer using reflection for Fear / Blight Cards unless used in the game play.


=====  Simple - Implement  ====

* Implement Face-up / face-down for deck cards so we can see what stage a card is before revealing it.
* Save DynamicTokens_ForGame to memento. / Clear DynamicTokens_ForRound when memento is restored.
* Visions of shifting future - use Randomizer so it is repeatable.

==== Finish ====

Settle into hunting grounds - implement presence cannot move.
Absolute Stasis - figue out how to not hide cities from Victory check
Slip the flows of time - use any # of times

==== Refactor / Cleanup ====

CardDrawer - get rid of power progression cards in tests, then make Card Drawer private and clean it up.
InvaderDeck.KeepBuildCards - can we make this go away. Make something cleaner?
Don't instanciate PowerCards / FearCards that are in the deck until they are drawn.
Make Spirit.ResolveActions private/protected.
Can we Set Spirit.GameState property and then not pass it everywhere?
TokenCountDictionary.counts -> make private.
Review items that are PickSpace then Pick Token into a single pick-space-token step.
CachedImageDrawer - make it draw the images
Convert TargetSpaceCtx action Methods to Commands

====  Test  ====

Check if Gates of Deepest Power has bug that allows duplicate cards. like 1 in discard and one in hand.
Check if anything is calling Spirit.GetTargetOptions directly and skipping over Shadows ability to pay to target.
TargetSpaceCtx.IsOneOf needs tests to ensure it uses Terrain Mapper.
Test GatherTheScatteredLightOfStars - to see if forgetting a power card creates a null card.
Volcano Looming High - check if spirit can place presence outside mountain during power card use.
Explosive Erruption should not destroy volcano presence - TEST!
RepeatCardForCost - Add test that it pulls from Used actions, NOT discard pile.
Make sure win/loss is checked after every spirit action / power card
TokenCountDictionary.MoveTo (test that correct events are published)
Review SpiritPresence.RemoveFrom_NoCheck( Space space, GameState gameState ) {
Don't let Pusher/Gatherer move frozen dahan. - add tests!
Test- Bats Scoutt... secondary damage didn't seem to be working.
TEST - Upgrading or downgrading explorers with strife, should maintain strife.

==== Token Management =====
WreakVengeanceForTheLandsCorruption - virtual tokens might not be correct.
Add Token.MoveFrom method to simplify Draw-Into-Void
HazardsSpreadAcrossTheIsland - should this trigger and AddToken event?
Presence as Tokens - Need access to GameState when doing Token Things
DahanGroupBinding.Drown should be async so UI will update.
Publish token events to the UI so that it can show token changing.

====  Not Yet Supported  =====

TheWoundedWildReturnsOnItsAssailants - fix once we support multiple players / boards
Weave together the Fabric... fix once we get multiple players / boards
Dream of the Untouched Land - implement once we support multiple players / boards
Visions of shifting Future - fix once we support events.
The Past Returns again - implement all spirits paying.
Pour Time Sideways 
	- Adding Explore on target board is not implemented. 
	- Adding Ravage on target board not implemented.  (should only add spaces that match card)
	- Add Build should filter on spaces that match card.

====  API  ====

Consilidate GameState API - things that aren't data and have no theoretical state.  Spirits could hand on to them and not have to pass gamestate around.


=========================================================


Cleanup..
	Merge Config Ravage and Ravage Engine
	* Simplify syntax for selecting TokensFromManySpaces
	* Consolidate => Single PresenceOnBoardChanged event
	* rollback virtual defence, hook from Presence / Tokens changed event.
	* ForgetCard
		- rename ForgetCard to ForgetCard_UserChoice
		- Consolidate the 2 ForgetCard methods into 1

GUI
	- layout of Fear / Blight items
	- Put Build / Ravage / fear in strip along the top 
	- display # of cards remaining in fear deck before next terror level
	- Configure Game - Images for Selecting Spirits / Boards / Token colors
	- Visual indicator of Phase
	- Show fear cards while they are being resolved.
	- Create a target-space preview, when hovering over cards
	- Show back side of explore card (so they no what stage it is)
	- Display Blight Card and/or text
	- Show backside of next explorer card

Game Engine 
	- Bind each Spirit Action to a CTX, so we can:
		- detect distinct actions
		- commit actions like transactions
		- Check win/lose state at the end of each action.


AI - Search
	- Create a search tree algorythm that can play the game
	- Heuristic to measure end-of-round goodness.

	Maximizes: Power Points Played - Ignore State of the board.

	Must be aware of:
	  - items that destroy presence or return it to board
	  - items that give energy
	  - card elements
	  - items that give extraw card plays or extra draw-cards.

	Categorize cards:
	  - Attack
	  - Defend
	  - Energy
	  - Card Plays
	  - Movement
	  - Fear




-- Helpful --

** Create a Token API  (MoveFrom,MoveTo,Destroy,Replace,Setup)

Refactor Testing to make it easier to test.

2) TargetSpaceCtx.DamageInvaders - limit badland damage to once / action

Make Push a 1-step commmand
	- for custom destinations, add them to Push API
	- Embed guaranteed next decision in selecting source token
	- UI selects entire move before sequentially submitting: source token, destination

== Road Map to Awesomeness ==
* HARD	Multi Player 
* MED	Multi Platform (Linux / Android)
* MED	Internet Play
* MED	AI Player
* EASY	Draw Power Cards
* EASY  DRAW Boards
* EASY  Draw Fear Cards

== Bonus - Fun ==

3 Show # of cards remaining in fear deck until next threshold

2 When presenting options, Icon-draw them.
3 draw innates - range icons, Target icons, clean tokens, +1 range
1 Cards ui - scrolling, decks & discard pile, 

===================

REFACTOR	InvaderGroup Damage/Destroy methods.  Create a virtual 'included tokens' group that combines single-token and token Group actions

Engine	Check Game Win/Loss

=====  no-events alternative  (page 20) ========

--- Setup ---

Add 1 extra fear card to Terror Level 2 of the Fear Deck.
	> create Fear Deck Configuration 
	> modify Fear Deck Configuration

Add the two 'Command Beasts' Reminder Cards to the Invader Deck; one before the first Stage 2 Card, the other before the first Stage 3  card
	> Change Invader Cards to use GameCmd, 
	> add the CommandBeast to the deck

Don't use a Blight Card where the Blighted Island side has 2 Blight per player or only immediate effects.  	(Still Healthy are fine though.)

--- Game Play ---

When reaching Invader Stage 2 and Invader Stage 3, the Spirits earn the abilito to command all Beasts on the island once.

Commanding Beasts requires consensus from all Spirits during the Fast phase.

For each beast, choose one of the following:

	* 1 Damage
	* Push the beast
	* If invaders are present, 1 fear.
