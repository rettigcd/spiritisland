4 UI - Graphics.DrawMixed(...)

4 UI - Draw Power Cards - OR Download them on the fly
4 UI - Draw Fear Cards OR Download them on the fly
4 UI - Cache: Innates

4 Standardize TokenSpace selection on receivers end.

4 Multi Player
	== Option 1 == 
		when starting action, make copy of the tokens
		- each action get an incremental ID
		- operate on the copy
		- track spaces
		- when done, commit => if any (spaces,spirits?,cards?) have been modified since start, rollback.
    -- Option 2 --
		- when interacting with spaces, have space join the Action
		- spaces that are part of an action cannot be joined to another action.
		- visual indication of which spaces are joined so user can wait or not select them
		- ! need to watch for deadlocks

4 Action => Move Finders Hook to Action-start - event

======

3 Flatten Fear Cards so user can pick SpaceToken instead of 2 step space then token
3 Change Fear Cards to Fluent Commands
3 UI - Cleanup Presence-Track image generation
3 UI - Make clickable things on screen into Buttons with their own .Click() method

3 UI - Tokens - Publish token events to the UI so that it can show token changing animation.
3 Review items that are PickSpace then Pick Token into a single pick-space-token step.

2 Consilidate GameState API - things that aren't data and have no theoretical state.
2 Review Presence events. Can they be removed by having Presence do action directly? Consolidate => Single PresenceOnBoardChanged event
2 UI - Clean up Token drawing and ownership - CachedImageDrawer - make it draw the images
2 Create a target-space preview, when hovering over cards

TokenCountDictionary.counts -> make private.
Make Spirit.ResolveActions private/protected.

Idea - UI - When cusororing over HotSpot, have selected item glow / highlight
Idea - All of the Stop Tokens are actually just Pre-Build, Pre-Explore, Pre-Ravage events/configures
Idea - Make Ravage / Build / Explore consistent in using UnitOfWork
Instead of reacting to PresenceMoved / Removed / Added events, have the Presence do the actions itself.
Review if any of the spirits Powers/actions can be refactored into a derived ActionalbeSpaceState

Later: Scenarios

===============================

== Architecture ==
Run on Android
Multiplayer Network Play

== UI improvement ==
Flatten Move
Event driven UI updates

== Verify ==
Visions of shifting Future - fix once we support events - use Randomizer so it is repeatable.
The Past Returns again - implement all spirits paying.

==========  AI - Search  =================

- Create a search tree algorythm that can play the game
- Heuristic to measure end-of-round goodness.

Maximizes: Power Points Played - Ignore State of the board.

Must be aware of:
	- items that destroy presence or return it to board
	- items that give energy
	- card elements
	- items that give extraw card plays or extra draw-cards.

Categorize cards:
	- Attack
	- Defend
	- Energy
	- Card Plays
	- Movement
	- Fear

-- Helpful --

Make Push a 1-step commmand
	- for custom destinations, add them to Push API
	- Embed guaranteed next decision in selecting source token
	- UI selects entire move before sequentially submitting: source token, destination
