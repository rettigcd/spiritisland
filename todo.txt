REFACTOR
When filtering, pass in TargetSpaceCtx instead of Space - simplify API by folding spirit and gamestate into Ctx

Need to Manually Select Damage - (I had 2 cities in River, each needing 1 damage, so massive flooding could kill them, but it applied 2 to 1.)

	- Visuals so we know when we are 
		(a) buying cards (b) selcting cards to play
		(a) selecting a push vs a gather space. (Lead the Furious assult)
	- logging game and results

Fix
	Based on the size of the first card, calculate width required, if insufficient, add scroll bar.
	At the end of each ActionTree (maybe after each invader is destroyed?), test if we have a Terror Level victory.
	IF user selects damage distribution, who makes the choice, and which actions do we keep as automatic?

Improve
	Manually select who to apply damage to
	Display Card modifications slow/fast

Unit Test
