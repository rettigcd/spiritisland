3+1? remaining Adversaries (Habsburg, Russia, Scotland, France?)

- - - - -

5 Move Finders Hook to Action-start

4 Slip the flows of time - use any # of times
4  Display Blight Card and/or text

3 Tokens - Publish token events to the UI so that it can show token changing animation.
3 Command-Beast - show graphic (so it doesn't get lost in text)
3 Visual indicator of Phase
3 Add special-rules logging as Debug, so we can see what happened.
3 Review items that are PickSpace then Pick Token into a single pick-space-token step.
3 Shifting Memory - Prepared elements.  Add them AFTER the action has completed.
3 Change Fear Card Ack to Events. (how do we do that?)
3 Configure Game - Images for Selecting Spirits

2 Consilidate GameState API - things that aren't data and have no theoretical state.
2 Merge Config Ravage and Ravage Engine
2 Review Presence events. Can they be removed by having Presence do action directly? Consolidate => Single PresenceOnBoardChanged event
2 Clean up Token drawing and ownership - CachedImageDrawer - make it draw the images
2 Create a target-space preview, when hovering over cards


TokenCountDictionary.counts -> make private.
Make Spirit.ResolveActions private/protected.
Convert TargetSpaceCtx action Methods to Commands

Idea - When cusororing over HotSpot, have selected item glow / highlight
Idea - All of the Stop Tokens are actually just Pre-Build, Pre-Explore, Pre-Ravage events/configures
Idea - Could the DoRavage token also be the Ravage Configuration used in ModifyRavage?
Idea - Make Ravage / Build / Explore consistent in using UnitOfWork

Instead of reacting to PresenceMoved / Removed / Added events, have the Presence do the actions itself.

Later: Events
Later: Scenarios

===============================

== Architecture ==
Run on Android
Multiplayer Network Play

== UI improvement ==
Flatten Move
Event driven UI updates

== Missing ==
Destroy Board
Unlock the Gates - triggers all element thresholds

== Verify ==
Visions of shifting Future - fix once we support events - use Randomizer so it is repeatable.
The Past Returns again - implement all spirits paying.

==========  AI - Search  =================

- Create a search tree algorythm that can play the game
- Heuristic to measure end-of-round goodness.

Maximizes: Power Points Played - Ignore State of the board.

Must be aware of:
	- items that destroy presence or return it to board
	- items that give energy
	- card elements
	- items that give extraw card plays or extra draw-cards.

Categorize cards:
	- Attack
	- Defend
	- Energy
	- Card Plays
	- Movement
	- Fear

-- Helpful --

Make Push a 1-step commmand
	- for custom destinations, add them to Push API
	- Embed guaranteed next decision in selecting source token
	- UI selects entire move before sequentially submitting: source token, destination

=====  Command the Beasts (page 20) ========

-- Setup --

Add 1 extra fear card to Terror Level 2 of the Fear Deck.
Add the two 'Command Beasts' Reminder Cards to the Invader Deck; one before the first Stage 2 Card, the other before the first Stage 3  card
Don't use a Blight Card where the Blighted Island side has 2 Blight per player or only immediate effects.  	(Still Healthy are fine though.)

-- Game Play --

When reaching Invader Stage 2 and Invader Stage 3, the Spirits earn the abilito to command all Beasts on the island once.

Commanding Beasts requires consensus from all Spirits during the Fast phase.

For each beast, choose one of the following:

	* 1 Damage
	* Push the beast
	* If invaders are present, 1 fear.
