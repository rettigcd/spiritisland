Power Card Troubles
	Invinite Vitality - (+4 dahan health) - don't add blight, solution: swap out Blight action,
	Increase Range // custom attribute on card that overrides normal
	Sap the Strength of Multitudes - range changes
	EntwinedPower  (Does a bunch of stuff with placing presence and sharing power cards) -- instead of passing SS and Presence, pass in enum tellit it which to use (then it can override that behavior)
	Vengence of the Dead - need a hook for when dahan/city/towns destroyed, 

Fix
	Words of Warning
	Based on the size of the first card, calculate width required, if insufficient, add scroll bar.
	While selecting cards, show total elements, allow selecting all cards before selecting 'done/commit'.  Select/Unselect.
	At the end of each ActionTree (maybe after each invader is destroyed?), test if we have a Terror Level victory.
