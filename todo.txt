BUG - Rampant green not given option to stop ravage with destroyed presence
IMP - Entwined share presence for targetting

Ocean

	On boards with you presence, treat oceans as coastal wetlands for powers and blight.

	Swallow the Land Dwellers - "Drown" generates energy for ocean

	Tidal Boon - Pushing Dahan into ocean, essencially pushes them into another costal
	Pushing Dahan into ocean destorys them - except for Tidal Boon

	May move presence into oceans.
	May not add/move presence into inlands.
	Drown Destorys invader pieces, for every (# of players) invaders drowned, gain 1 energy

== multiple versions of Earth ==
strange one is here:

Display destroyed presence
make SS dispay differently

UI		Display Spirit Name / Image
UI		Display $$ / Destroyed presence

BASE	Ocean
CORE	Split Growth Option into parts

UI  Re-evaluate Buttons - change to dropdown?  run along top to get more width for spirit card?
UI	Cards - scroll bar
UI	Display Growth Options in GUI
UI	show COLOR presence on board - GUI
UI	click on invaders on board - GUI
UI	Fix Fear card experience - logging or showing cards
UI	Enhance Ravage / Build images


BASE	Review Major / Minor, decide which need Unit Tests and Implement - Targets SPIRITS
BONUS	Generate Innate images from innate metadata

== Done ==




== Test Special Cases ==
Conceiling Shadows - no damage to dahan
A Year of Perfect Stillness - skips invader actions
Talons of Lightning - extended / conditional range 
Words of Warning - dahan strike at same time as defenders


Power Card Troubles
	Invinite Vitality - (+4 dahan health) - don't add blight, solution: swap out Blight action,
	Increase Range // custom attribute on card that overrides normal
	Sap the Strength of Multitudes - range changes
	EntwinedPower  (Does a bunch of stuff with placing presence and sharing power cards) -- instead of passing SS and Presence, pass in enum tellit it which to use (then it can override that behavior)
	Vengence of the Dead - need a hook for when dahan/city/towns destroyed, 

Fix
	Based on the size of the first card, calculate width required, if insufficient, add scroll bar.
	At the end of each ActionTree (maybe after each invader is destroyed?), test if we have a Terror Level victory.
	IF user selects damage distribution, who makes the choice, and which actions do we keep as automatic?

Improve
	Manually select who to apply damage to
	Display Icons (white w/#s)
	Display Card modifications slow/fast

Unit Test
	Thunderspeakers - move-with-the-dahan
	Harbinger of the Lightning
		- Elements, speed, cost
		- target - range 1
		- push 2 dahan
		- pushed into town or city triggers 1 fear
			- 2 pushed into same > 1
			- 2 pushed into different > 1
			- 1 pushed into town > 1
			- 1 pushed into city > 1
			- 1 pushed into explorer > 0
		- no dahan to push > doesn't crash

	Destroying Town or Town1 creates 1 fear
	Destroying City, City1, City 2, creates 2 fear
