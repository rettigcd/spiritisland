== Jonah ideas ===
Display destroyed presence
make SS dispay differently

== Test Special Cases ==
Conceiling Shadows - no damage to dahan
A Year of Perfect Stillness - skips invader actions
Talons of Lightning - extended / conditional range 
Words of Warning - dahan strike at same time as defenders

== Problems & Solutions ==
RAVAGE ENGINE - Conceiling Shadows - no damage to dahan
RAVAGE ENGINE - Infinite Vitality - override Ragage Engine
RAVAGE ENGINE - Rengence of the dead - override Ravage engine
PP ENGINE - Entwined Power - implement place-presence engine and override it
DO - Blazing Renewal - no problem, just implement
DO - Dissalow selecting growth option that requires money spirit doesn't have.
DO - PowerStormg - pay for card again.  (Not hard, just implement)
DO - WindsOfRustAndAtrophy - not hard, just implement
DO - Dissolve the Bonds of Kinship - no problem, just implement
IF user selects damage distribution, who makes the choice, and which actions do we keep as automatic?

Power Card Troubles
	Invinite Vitality - (+4 dahan health) - don't add blight, solution: swap out Blight action,
	Increase Range // custom attribute on card that overrides normal
	Sap the Strength of Multitudes - range changes
	EntwinedPower  (Does a bunch of stuff with placing presence and sharing power cards) -- instead of passing SS and Presence, pass in enum tellit it which to use (then it can override that behavior)
	Vengence of the Dead - need a hook for when dahan/city/towns destroyed, 

Fix
	Based on the size of the first card, calculate width required, if insufficient, add scroll bar.
	At the end of each ActionTree (maybe after each invader is destroyed?), test if we have a Terror Level victory.

Improve
	Manually select who to apply damage to
	Display Icons (white w/#s)
	Display Card modifications slow/fast

Unit Test
	Thunderspeakers - move-with-the-dahan
	Harbinger of the Lightning
		- Elements, speed, cost
		- target - range 1
		- push 2 dahan
		- pushed into town or city triggers 1 fear
			- 2 pushed into same > 1
			- 2 pushed into different > 1
			- 1 pushed into town > 1
			- 1 pushed into city > 1
			- 1 pushed into explorer > 0
		- no dahan to push > doesn't crash

	Destroying Town or Town1 creates 1 fear
	Destroying City, City1, City 2, creates 2 fear
