Scream Disease Into The Wind

// !!! When blight is added to target land, it doesn't cascade. - (Entrap the Forces of Corruption)


Cleanup..
	Merge Config Ravage and Ravage Engine
	Beast, Wilds, Disease should implement both Token and TokenGroup
	* Simplify syntax for selecting TokensFromManySpaces
	* Consolidate => Single TokensOnBoardChanged event
	* Consolidate => Single PresenceOnBoardChanged event
	* rollback virtual defence, hook from Presence / Tokens changed event.
	* ForgetCard
		- rename ForgetCard to ForgetCard_UserChoice
		- Consolidate the 2 ForgetCard methods into 1

GUI
	- layout of Fear / Blight items
	- Put Build / Ravage / fear in strip along the top 
	- display # of cards remaining in fear deck before next terror level
	- Configure Game - Images for Selecting Spirits / Boards / Token colors
	- Visual indicator of Phase
	- Show fear cards while they are being resolved.
	- Create a target-space preview, when hovering over cards
	- Show back side of explore card (so they no what stage it is)

Game Engine 
	- Bind each Spirit Action to a CTX, so we can:
		- detect distinct actions
		- commit actions like transactions
		- Check win/lose state at the end of each action.


AI - Search
	- Create a search tree algorythm that can play the game
	- Heuristic to measure end-of-round goodness.

	Maximizes: Power Points Played - Ignore State of the board.

	Must be aware of:
	  - items that destory presence or return it to board
	  - items that give energy
	  - card elements
	  - items that give extraw card plays or extra draw-cards.

	Categorize cards:
	  - Attack
	  - Defend
	  - Energy
	  - Card Plays
	  - Movement
	  - Fear




-- Helpful --

** Create a Token API  (MoveFrom,MoveTo,Destroy,Replace,Setup)

Refactor Testing to make it easier to test.

2) TargetSpaceCtx.DamageInvaders - limit badland damage to once / action

Make Push a 1-step commmand
	- for custom destinations, add them to Push API
	- Embed guaranteed next decision in selecting source token
	- UI selects entire move before sequentially submitting: source token, destination
