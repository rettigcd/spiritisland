1	(3)	10 (3/4/3)	Trading Port: After Setup, in Coastal lands, Explore Cards add 1 Townicon.png instead of 1 Explorericon.png . "Coastal Lands" Invader cards do this for maximum 2 lands per board.
2	(4)	11 (4/4/3)	Seize Opportunity: During Setup, add 1 Cityicon.png to land #2. Place "Coastal Lands" as the 3rd Stage II card, and move the two Stage II Cards above it up by one. (New Deck Order: 11-22-1-C2-33333, where C is the Stage II Coastal Lands Card.)
3	(6)	13 (4/5/4)	Chart the Coastline: In Coastal lands, Build Cards affect lands without Invaders, so long as there is an adjacent Cityicon.png.
4	(7)	14 (5/5/4)	Ambition of a Minor Nation: During Setup, replace the bottom Stage I Card with the bottom Stage III Card. (New Deck Order: 11-22-3-C2-3333))
5	(8)	15 (5/6/4)	Runoff and Bilgewater: After a Ravage Action adds Blighticon.png to a Coastal Land, add 1 Blighticon.png to that board's Ocean (without cascading). Treat the Ocean as a Coastal Wetland for this rule and for Blighticon.png removal/movement.
6	(10)	16 (6/6/4)	Exports Fuel Inward Growth: After the Ravage step, add 1 Townicon.png to each Inland land that matches a Ravage card and is within 1 of town/city
