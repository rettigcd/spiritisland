Command-the-Beast does not activate from Saved Games, only new games

=====  Fear Bugs  ====
Unrest - Reduced City health by 1 but didn't get health icon.
Seek Safety - Allowed for pushing explorer to space with no town / city.

(Sense of Dread OR Activating Fear): LEVEL-2 HAS bug that locks up game.


=====  Finder bugs  ====
Reread this and see if anything is wrong: https://querki.net/raw/darker/spirit-island-faq/Open+the+Ways+%28Finder+of+Paths+Unseen%29
Adjaceny seems to still work for Invaders, or maybe just coastal

Configure Finder the option to change Adjacents at the start of each Action except invader actions
Show Fear Card before creating Fear Action

The Move presence on the presence track is forced (is that correct?) 
	AND the UI doesn't select it properly

======================

Settle Into Hunting-Grounds
	- implement "May" count as badlands and beast.

Growth - After Growth, rewinding to beginning of turn, doesn't reset # of card plays to 0
