=====  Shifting Memories  ========

After Growth, rewinding to beginning of turn, doesn't reset # of card plays to 0

Shifting Memories 2-elements for card play - doesn't always work

=====  Space / Board related bugs  ======

* View Absolute Stasis tokens / spaces.

* Dream of the Untouched Land
	- adding new island board does not not work.

* Weave Together the Fabric of Place
	- Can't see tokens
	- Does it even work?

===============================

Trade Suffers: 1 : Invaders do not Build in lands with City.
	- Was going to have 2 builds, stopped 1, but England escalation built there on the 2nd build anyway

When 1 strifed and 1 not town, draws Strifed, then unstrifed.
	when unstrifed is damaged, it switches to first.  (need to keep Strife as the major ording and damage second.)

Settle Into Hunting-Grounds
	- implement "May" count as badlands and beast.
	- presence cannot move.

Fear of the Unseen - 1
	- did not let me pick town, only option was explorer.

Retreat : 2 : Each player may Push up to 3 Explorer / Town from an Inland land
	did not trigger SMOA Element

Bargains of Power and Protection - defense does not roll back when Rewinding
