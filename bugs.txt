====  Bringer Bugs  =====
Devouring Ants Destroyed Dahan
Dread Apparistion Rewind or something is creating too many defends



=====  Fear Bugs  ====
Unrest - Reduced City health by 1 but didn't get health icon.
To Many Monsters - Let user choose explorer or town to move/destroy
Seek Safety - Allowed for pushing explorer to space with no town / city.

=====  Volcano Bugs  =====

Volcano doesn't get to choose where it places its' presence at the beginning of the game, so you can't do anything and get softlocked.

======================

Finder:
	The Move presence on the presence track is forced (is that correct) 
		AND the UI doesn't select it properly

Settle Into Hunting-Grounds
	- implement "May" count as badlands and beast.
	- presence cannot move.

Growth - After Growth, rewinding to beginning of turn, doesn't reset # of card plays to 0

Growth - Shifting Memories 2-elements for card play - doesn't always work
