=====  Shifting Memories  ========

After Growth, rewinding to beginning of turn, doesn't reset # of card plays to 0

Shifting Memories 2-elements for card play - doesn't always work

=====  Space / Board related bugs  ======

* View Absolute Stasis tokens / spaces.

* Dream of the Untouched Land
	- adding new island board does not not work.

* Weave Together the Fabric of Place
	- Can't see tokens
	- Does it even work?

===============================

Settle Into Hunting-Grounds
	- implement "May" count as badlands and beast.
	- presence cannot move.

Fear of the Unseen - 1
	- did not let me pick town, only option was explorer.

Retreat : 2 : Each player may Push up to 3 Explorer / Town from an Inland land
	did not trigger SMOA Element

Bargains of Power and Protection - defense does not roll back when Rewinding



=============

Twilight Fog Brings madness, dahan not moved is destroyed instead of taking 1 point of damage.

!!! Tokens_ForIslands.RegisterDynamic actions to not reset when we Rewind.
!!! Triggering Elements needs to use token in space as count so Rewind works.


Option 1: DefaultSourceCalc could use TargetSpaceCtx directly
Option 2: Spirits that use modify space terrain, also override Spirit.SourceCalc

Victory: Terror Level 2 - no towns or cities (still have strifed town)


== 2 Spirit Thoughts ==

How to make Actions Atomic
	- Don't Enforce it
	- Let UI enforce it by only allowing 1 Growth/Fast/Slow action to be selected at a time
	- Let engine enforce it by only allowing 1 G/F/S action to be selected at a time.

! UI facilitate switching back and forth for multiple spirits.

! Configure Game allow 2 spirits.


! Bug - Water Nourishes Life's Growth
	- allows remove presence from anywhere but should only be on target land.

! Bug - Confounding Mists, when played for pushing added items, is not Rewindable, AND leaves the added item behind.
