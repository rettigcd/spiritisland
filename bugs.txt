=====  Fear Bugs  ====
Unrest - Reduced City health by 1 but didn't get health icon.
Seek Safety - Allowed for pushing explorer to space with no town / city.

=====  Volcano Bugs  =====

Volcano doesn't get to choose where it places its' presence at the beginning of the game, so you can't do anything and get softlocked.

=====  Finder bugs  ====
Reread this and see if anything is wrong: https://querki.net/raw/darker/spirit-island-faq/Open+the+Ways+%28Finder+of+Paths+Unseen%29
Adjaceny seems to still work for Invaders, or maybe just coastal

Configure Finder the option to change Adjacents at the start of each Action except invader actions
Show Fear Card before creating Fear Action

======================

Finder:
	The Move presence on the presence track is forced (is that correct) 
		AND the UI doesn't select it properly

Settle Into Hunting-Grounds
	- implement "May" count as badlands and beast.
	- presence cannot move.

Growth - After Growth, rewinding to beginning of turn, doesn't reset # of card plays to 0

Growth - Shifting Memories 2-elements for card play - doesn't always work
