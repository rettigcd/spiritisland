Idea! for ease of presence testing,  replace Board A with a Test board that has lots of lands in a line.



Growth that needs resolved:

	- where to place presence
	- which track to take presence from
	? With .ResolvePresence(...)

	- Which Power Cards are being drawn (major/minor)

	- Which 1 card is being reclaimed


!!! Test Initial Sprit Player State
!!! Test Presence Tracks
!!! Test Placing Initial Presence on different boards


Resolve - All Information - Presence
Resolve - Hidden - next Draw Cards



Grow1()
Grow2()
Grow3(PlacePresenseHere(...))

var unresolved = Grow(1);
PlacePresnseOn(unresolved);
Reclaim1(unresolved,card4);


Issue1a - resolving Grow w/ info known
Issue1b - resolveing Grow w/ info hidden
Issue2b - metadata querying spirit / spirit UI

PendingItems items = Grow(1);
while(items.Count>0){
	items.PlacePresence(Space);
	items.PlacePresence();
	items.ReclaimCard();
}

=> place presence   (known) make part of command   ALL
=> select reclaim1  (known) make part of command   MANY
=> draw minor (pass selector to )   ALL
=> draw major   ALL





== PlacePresence Options ==
Place Presence is Data (range + criteria) and passed to Spirit, but then spirit knows what PP is.
When Getting Options, Spirit preloads Spirits starting presence

? if spirit preload initial presence, then place presence need to be treated as a whole
? if we want to mix and match, presence could be separate with intermediate states.

=== Things that need resolved ===
Resolve 1
Draw Cards
Place Presence


??????????? can program query the different growth actions ???????????????

Pass a Block to deal with intermediate state?   Multiple blocks?


Specify: (Reclaim Card)
Specify: Presence
Specify: Drawn PowerCard
